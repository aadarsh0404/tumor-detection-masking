## Project Overview

Brain Tumor Detection using Masking is an innovative project that employs advanced image processing techniques to detect brain tumors in medical images. This project utilizes image segmentation and masking to accurately identify and isolate regions of interest within brain scans, providing valuable insights for medical professionals and researchers.

## Key Features

- **Segmentation with Masking:** Advanced image segmentation isolates potential tumor regions using masks to focus on relevant areas and improve detection accuracy.

- **Tumor Detection:** The project detects potential brain tumors by analyzing the segmented regions, highlighting suspected tumor areas for medical professionals to review.

- **Visualization:** Visualizations of original scans, segmented areas, and detection results aid in understanding the process and outcomes.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface allows users to upload brain scan images, initiate detection, and view results conveniently.

## Why This Project Matters

Early detection of brain tumors is vital for patient outcomes. This project bridges medical imaging and technology, empowering professionals to make informed decisions based on accurate tumor detection.
